### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is UMMIDI CHANDRIKA, I am currently a Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological university, Vizianagaram. I am always curious about how a square centimetre comprises millions of devices. It's quite interesting to write such codes that allow manufacturers to make efficient devices. Digital Electronics is my favourite subject, The World of 0 and 1 fascinated me

âœ¨Technical Proficiencies Include:

ðŸ”¸HDL: Verilog

ðŸ”¸HVL: SystemVerilog

ðŸ”¸VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY: Constraint Random Coverage Driven-Verification | Assertion Based Verification - SVA

ðŸ”¸TB Methodology: UVM( Universal Verification Methodology)

ðŸ”¸EDA TOOLS:Mentor Graphics-Questasim, Modelsim, Intel Quartus Prime, Xilinx ISE 14.7

ðŸ”¸DOMAIN: ASIC/FPGA front-end Design and Verification

ðŸ”¸Protocols : I2C, UART , SPI, APB, AHB, AXI

ðŸ”¸PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: C[Datatype Array | Pointers List Memory Allocation | Functions Queues and stacks] || C++ [Oops Concepts, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction]

ðŸ”¸OPERATING SYSTEMS:Linux, Windows 

ðŸ”¸CORE SKILLS: [RTL Coding using Synthesizable constructs of Verilog | FSM based design Simulation | CMOS Fundamentals Code Coverage | Functional Coverage |Synthesis | Static Timing Analysis | Assertion Based Verification using System Verilog Assertions]


HERE ARE MY OTHER SKILLS

MATLAB || Microsoft Office || MASM Software || Multisim || Proteus Software

This repository will act as a resume where I can show off my skills in form of projects that acts as a testament. And I will add more repositories in future to develop a great collections of things that I am into.

Projects I have worked on to build my Portfolio:
* 100DaysofRTL
* Router 1*3 RTL Design and Verification
* AHB2APB Bridge IP Core Verification
* Design of UART Protocol using Verilog
* Design and Verification of Asynchronous FIFO

  Future Projects :
  * UVM CODING from Basics to Advanced
  * PROTOCOLS
